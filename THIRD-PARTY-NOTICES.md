# Third-Party Notices

`dftracer-utils` bundles and links the third-party components listed below. Each
is fetched at configure time (via CPM, see `cmake/modules/Dependencies.cmake`)
and statically or dynamically linked into the libraries, CLI binaries, and
Python extension. Each component remains under its own license, reproduced in
full in that component's source tree (under `.cpmsource/<name>/.../LICENSE`
after a build) and available at the linked homepage.

This project itself is licensed under the terms in [LICENSE](LICENSE); the
notices here cover only the third-party dependencies.

## Notes

- Dual-licensed components (Highway, RocksDB, simdjson, Zstandard) are used under
  the permissive option listed first (Apache-2.0 / BSD-3-Clause), never the GPL
  option.
- moodycamel's queues embed Jeff Preshing's semaphore implementation, which
  carries a `Zlib` license (see the note in each queue's `LICENSE.md`).
- Exact pinned versions are defined in `cmake/modules/Dependencies.cmake`; that
  file is the source of truth for what is fetched.
- The lists above are generated from the dependencies actually vendored into the
  build (`.cpmsource/`). Some entries in `Dependencies.cmake` are conditional and
  are only fetched for certain configurations.
