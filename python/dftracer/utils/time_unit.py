"""Time-unit selection for normalizing trace ``ts``/``dur``.

DFTracer traces declare their native time unit via a leading ``CM`` time_metric
metadata event, and different runs can emit different units (ns/us/ms/sec).
Consumers that need a fixed unit pass a target here; the reader scales from the
trace's native unit to it.
