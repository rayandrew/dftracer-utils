:description: Have plugins share data within one scan by publishing and consuming batch-scoped ports.

How to communicate between plugins
====================================

.. admonition:: Goal
   :class: goal

   Have one plugin publish a value during a batch and another plugin
   consume it, within the one shared scan ``--plugin a --plugin b`` already
   runs. See :doc:`../../plugins` for the plugin model this builds on.

**Ports** (``DFTU_SVC_PORTS``) are the one mechanism: a producer publishes a
value during a batch and a consumer reads it back in the same batch. A port is
a name, and the two ends are wired by naming the same one. The ``dftu.``
prefix is reserved for the host; a port that ever needs a version carries it
in the name.

Ports: publish and consume
----------------------------

A port is a batch-scoped slot, identified by its name, that resets between
batches. A producer writes to it during the batch fold; a
consumer reads it back during the same batch.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: C++ (SDK)

      The ``Host`` wrapper (``dftracer/utils/plugins/plugin.h``) exposes ports
      as a typed pair, ``publish_port<T>``/``consume_port<T>``, built once from
      a port name and used every batch through ``send``/``recv``:

      .. code-block:: cpp

         template <class T> OutPort<T> publish_port(const char* cap_id) const;
         template <class T> InPort<T> consume_port(const char* cap_id) const;

         // OutPort<T>: void send(const T& v) const;
         // InPort<T>:  std::optional<T> recv() const;

      ``T`` must be trivially copyable; the host copies ``sizeof(T)`` bytes per
      publish. A producer built with ``dftracer::utils::plugins::make_plugin<Slice>``
      publishes from its ``step`` and names the port in a static ``provides()``:

      .. code-block:: cpp

         #include <dftracer/utils/plugins/plugin.h>

         constexpr const char* PORT_CAP = "com.example.perbatch";

         struct ProducerSlice {
             static auto provides() {
                 return std::array<const char*, 1>{PORT_CAP};
             }

             explicit ProducerSlice(const dftracer::utils::plugins::Config&) {}
             void step(const dftracer::utils::plugins::Batch& b, dftracer::utils::plugins::Host h) {
                 std::uint64_t with_dur = 0;
                 for (const dftracer::utils::plugins::Event& e : b)
                     if (e.has_dur()) ++with_dur;
                 h.publish_port<std::uint64_t>(PORT_CAP).send(with_dur);
             }
             void merge(ProducerSlice&) {}
             void finalize(dftracer::utils::plugins::Host) {}
         };

         dftu_plugin* dftracer_plugin(dftu_plugin_host* h, const dftu_value* config) {
             (void)h;
             return dftracer::utils::plugins::make_plugin<ProducerSlice>(config);
         }

      A consumer reads it back with the same port name, named in its own
      static ``consumes()`` so the host runs the producer first:

      .. code-block:: cpp

         struct ConsumerSlice {
             static auto consumes() {
                 return std::array<const char*, 1>{PORT_CAP};
             }

             explicit ConsumerSlice(const dftracer::utils::plugins::Config&) {}
             void step(const dftracer::utils::plugins::Batch&, dftracer::utils::plugins::Host h) {
                 if (auto with_dur = h.consume_port<std::uint64_t>(PORT_CAP).recv()) {
                     // ... use *with_dur for this batch
                 }
             }
             void merge(ConsumerSlice&) {}
             void finalize(dftracer::utils::plugins::Host) {}
         };

   .. tab-item:: C (raw ABI)

      A plugin fetches the raw port channel from the host through
      ``host->get_service(host->h, DFTU_SVC_PORTS)``:

      .. code-block:: c

         typedef struct dftu_svc_ports {
             uint64_t (*port_key)(void* h, const char* cap_id);
             void (*publish)(void* h, uint64_t key, const void* data, uint32_t len);
             const void* (*consume)(void* h, uint64_t key, uint32_t* out_len);
         } dftu_svc_ports;

      ``port_key`` interns a port name once (cache the returned
      ``uint64_t``); ``publish`` copies ``len`` bytes into the batch-scoped
      slot; ``consume`` returns a borrowed pointer valid only until the
      current ``on_batch`` returns (NULL if nothing was published this batch).
      A producer's ``on_batch`` reads the ``ph`` column to mirror
      ``Event::has_dur()`` (a duration means ``phase() == Complete``):

      .. code-block:: c

         static dftu_task* on_batch(void* slice, const dftu_dataframe* df,
                                    const dftu_plugin_host* host) {
             MyState* s = (MyState*)slice;
             const dftu_svc_ports* ports =
                 (const dftu_svc_ports*)host->get_service(host->h, DFTU_SVC_PORTS);
             if (!s->port_key) s->port_key = ports->port_key(host->h, "com.example.perbatch");

             int64_t n = dftu_dataframe_num_rows(df);
             dftu_series* ph_col = dftu_dataframe_column(df, "ph");
             const int64_t* ph = (ph_col && dftu_series_type(ph_col) == DFTU_TYPE_INT64)
                 ? (const int64_t*)dftu_series_data(ph_col) : NULL;
             uint64_t with_dur = 0;
             int64_t i;
             if (ph)
                 for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
                     if (ph[i] == DFTU_PH_COMPLETE) ++with_dur;
             if (ph_col) dftu_series_free(ph_col);
             ports->publish(host->h, s->port_key, &with_dur, sizeof(with_dur));
             return NULL;  /* synchronous */
         }

      and a consumer reads it back with the same key:

      .. code-block:: c

         static dftu_task* on_batch(void* slice, const dftu_dataframe* df,
                                    const dftu_plugin_host* host) {
             MyState* s = (MyState*)slice;
             const dftu_svc_ports* ports =
                 (const dftu_svc_ports*)host->get_service(host->h, DFTU_SVC_PORTS);
             if (!s->port_key) s->port_key = ports->port_key(host->h, "com.example.perbatch");

             (void)df;
             uint32_t len = 0;
             const void* v = ports->consume(host->h, s->port_key, &len);
             if (v && len == sizeof(uint64_t)) {
                 uint64_t with_dur; memcpy(&with_dur, v, sizeof(with_dur));
                 /* ... use with_dur for this batch */
             }
             return NULL;
         }

   .. tab-item:: Python (JIT)

      A ``@jit.plugin`` class declares a port with ``jit.publish`` /
      ``jit.consume`` as a class attribute, then writes or reads it inside
      ``@jit.each_event``. A publish port accumulates a per-batch total with
      ``self.<port> += <expr>``; the host sums the per-event contributions and
      publishes the total once the batch finishes. A consume port is read as a
      plain scalar, ``self.<port>`` (``0`` when no producer has published yet):

      .. code-block:: python

         from dftracer.utils import jit

         @jit.plugin
         class Producer:
             sig = jit.publish("com.example.perbatch", of=jit.u64)

             @jit.each_event
             def step(self, e):
                 if e.has_dur:
                     self.sig += 1

         @jit.plugin
         class Consumer:
             sig = jit.consume("com.example.perbatch", of=jit.u64)

             @jit.each_event
             def step(self, e):
                 if self.sig > 0:               # a producer published this batch
                     pass                        # ... use self.sig for this batch

      ``of`` picks the wire width shared by both ends (``jit.u64`` / ``jit.i64``
      / ``jit.f64``); it must match on both the publisher and the consumer. A
      consume port is read-only and a publish port is write-only; writing to a
      consume port (or reading a publish port) raises ``JitError`` at
      decoration time. A missing producer degrades to reading ``0``. A JIT
      producer and a hand-written C++ or C consumer (or
      vice versa) interoperate freely: all three compile down to the same
      ``DFTU_SVC_PORTS`` machinery.

The ordering rule
-------------------

A consumer sees nothing published (``std::nullopt`` in C++, NULL in C, ``0``
in JIT) whenever the producer has not published for the current batch - most
commonly because it runs after the consumer. Name the port in the consumer's
``consumes`` and the producer's ``provides`` (a single NULL-terminated name
array per plugin, one namespace shared with accumulator names, section 6 of
:doc:`../../plugins`): the host orders the fold from that declaration, running
every provider of a consumed name first, and refuses to run the set at all if
no loaded plugin provides it. There is no ``--plugin`` flag order to get
right.

A value published in one batch does not carry over to the next: the host
clears every port between batches, so a consumer sees nothing published until
that batch's producer publishes again.

In C++, ``recv()`` copies the published bytes into the returned
``std::optional<T>``, so the result is safe to keep past the current
``on_batch``/``step`` call without any manual copying. In C, ``consume``
returns a pointer that is only valid until ``on_batch`` returns; copy it out
if you need it longer.
