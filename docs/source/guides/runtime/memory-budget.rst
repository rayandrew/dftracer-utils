:description: Keep a scan or aggregation inside a memory ceiling: cap and spill a view's group map, and check whether a footprint fits across nodes.

Bound memory usage
==================

.. admonition:: Goal
   :class: goal

   Keep a scan or aggregation inside a memory ceiling instead of letting the
   group map grow until the process is killed. Two tools do this: a builder setting
   on the view that caps and spills intermediate memory, and a free advisory that
   tells you whether a required footprint fits and how many nodes to spread it
   across.

Cap and spill a view
--------------------

``View::memory_budget(bytes)`` (in ``dftracer/utils/trace/views/view.h``,
namespace ``dftracer::utils::trace::views``) sets one ceiling that bounds two
things during a run, both intermediate memory, never the returned result:

- **Scan decode.** The bytes decompressed concurrently across worker slices are
  always held under the ceiling, so a large trace cannot OOM the box. This bound
  is always on: with no explicit budget it defaults to a RAM fraction (about one
  third of detected, cgroup-aware memory), and a single unit larger than the
  whole ceiling still runs once the scan is otherwise idle rather than
  deadlocking. A scan that cannot make progress fails loudly instead of hanging.
- **Group-map spill.** Set an explicit non-zero ``bytes`` and each worker's
  aggregation group map spills to sorted temporary runs past that size. ``0``
  (the default) keeps the group map purely in memory - no spilling - while the
  scan-decode bound above still applies.

``auto_spill()`` is the convenience form: it caps at roughly one third of
available memory, enabling group-map spill at that size. Both are chainable and
available on the Python viewer too. Pick an explicit ``memory_budget`` when an
aggregation's distinct-group count is large enough to want spilling; leave it
unset to rely on the always-on scan-decode default.

               .group_by("cat")
               .agg("sum:dur")
               .collect()                    # -> LazyFrame
               .collect()                    # -> DataFrame
         )

         spilled = tv.auto_spill().group_by("cat").agg("count").collect().collect()

Check a footprint before you run
--------------------------------

``memory_budget_advice`` judges a required byte footprint against available
memory (auto-detected and cgroup-aware when you pass ``0`` or omit it). It
returns whether the footprint fits, the peak it expects, and how many nodes
would spread that peak under the available limit.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: C++

      .. code-block:: cpp

         #include <dftracer/utils/core/common/memory_budget.h>
         using namespace dftracer::utils;

         MemoryBudgetAdvice advice =
             memory_budget_advice(/*required_bytes=*/40ull * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);

         if (!advice.fits) {
             std::cerr << format_memory_budget_warning(advice) << '\n';
             // advice.suggested_nodes: nodes to spread the peak under available
         }

   .. tab-item:: Python

      .. code-block:: python

         from dftracer.utils.dftracer_utils_ext import memory_budget_advice

         advice = memory_budget_advice(required_bytes=40 * 1024**3)
         # dict: fits, required_bytes, peak_bytes, available_bytes,
         #       suggested_nodes, warning
         if not advice["fits"]:
             print(advice["warning"])
             print("spread across", advice["suggested_nodes"], "nodes")

The returned advice carries ``fits`` (peak within available), ``required_bytes``
(what you passed), ``peak_bytes`` (required times a peak factor),
``available_bytes`` (what it judged against), and ``suggested_nodes``. The C++
struct is ``MemoryBudgetAdvice``; the Python function returns the same fields as
a dict plus a ``warning`` string (empty when it fits).

.. note::

   ``compute_memory_budget`` and ``estimate_per_file_bytes`` (same C++ header)
   compute a budget and a per-file estimate from a list of file sizes. They are
   C++-only; the viewer calls ``compute_memory_budget`` internally to pick a
   default. Only ``memory_budget_advice`` is exposed as a standalone Python
   function.
