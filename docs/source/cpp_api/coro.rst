Coroutine API
=============

.. seealso::

   For complete class and member documentation, see the
   :doc:`API Reference <api/coro>`.


C++20 coroutine primitives for asynchronous task execution. All classes are in the ``dftracer::utils::coro`` namespace.

For usage examples and task scheduling, see :doc:`/pipeline` and :doc:`pipeline/tasks`.

.. note::

   GCC 12 may corrupt large coroutine frames at ``-O2`` and above, especially
   when frames contain references, ``string_view``, or captured lambdas. The
   project mitigates this by heap-allocating per-task state in a
   ``shared_ptr`` (or ``unique_ptr``) and capturing only the smart pointer in
   coroutine lambdas, instead of capturing complex state by value. New
   coroutines should follow the same pattern; see ``coroutine-caveats.md`` at
   the repo root for the full discussion.

Coro
----

Lightweight fire-and-forget coroutine type with no return value.

Coro is the internal execution primitive used by the runtime. Unlike CoroTask<T>, Coro:

- Has no return value (communicate through channels)
- Has no continuation chain (flat scheduling)
- Integrates with JoinHandle for structured concurrency
- Automatically manages its own lifetime via release() semantics

Users typically interact with Task and CoroScope instead of using Coro directly.

JoinHandle
----------

Stack-allocated join barrier for coordinating multiple Coro instances.

Uses a thread-safe counter pattern to synchronize completion of a group of coroutines.
When all tracked coroutines complete, the awaiter is resumed via symmetric transfer.

**Stack-bound lifetime:** JoinHandle is non-copyable, non-movable, and must outlive all tracked coroutines.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   JoinHandle jh;
   jh.track(coro1);
   jh.track(coro2);
   // ... enqueue coroutines to executor ...
   co_await jh.join();  // suspends until all tracked coroutines complete

SpawnFuture
-----------

Future returned by ``CoroScope::spawn()`` for all coroutines (both void and typed).

``spawn()`` always returns ``SpawnFuture<T>`` (where ``T`` is ``void`` for void coroutines).
The future is awaitable and suspends the caller until the spawned coroutine completes,
then returns the typed result. It uses a lock-free shared state (``SharedState<T>``) with one
heap allocation per spawn.

For fire-and-forget usage, the return value can simply be discarded.

**Awaitable interface:**

- ``await_ready()`` - Returns true if result is already available
- ``await_suspend()`` - Registers the awaiter to be resumed on completion
- ``await_resume()`` - Returns the result or re-throws any exception
- ``is_done()`` - Check if the spawned coroutine has completed without blocking
- ``detach()`` - Prevent automatic resumption (used by when_any)

Usage examples:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // Await a typed spawn directly:
   int result = co_await scope.spawn([](CoroScope& s) -> CoroTask<int> {
       co_return 42;
   });

   // Or capture the future for later:
   SpawnFuture<int> future = scope.spawn([](CoroScope& s) -> CoroTask<int> {
       co_return 42;
   });
   int result = co_await future;

   // Await a void spawn:
   co_await scope.spawn([](CoroScope& s) -> CoroTask<void> {
       // caller suspends until this completes
       co_return;
   });

   // Fire-and-forget (discard the SpawnFuture):
   scope.spawn([](CoroScope& s) -> CoroTask<void> {
       co_return;
   });

Yield Primitives
----------------

Control coroutine scheduling and timeslice behavior.

``yield()`` unconditionally suspends and re-enqueues the coroutine on the executor.

``maybe_yield()`` conditionally yields only if the current thread's timeslice has been exceeded.
This is a low-cost operation (~25ns clock read) when the timeslice is not exceeded.

**Timeslice management:**

- ``reset_timeslice()`` - Reset the current thread's timeslice clock to now
- ``timeslice_exceeded()`` - Check whether the current thread has exceeded its timeslice
- ``set_timeslice_duration()`` - Set the timeslice duration for the current thread
- ``get_timeslice_duration()`` - Get the timeslice duration for the current thread
- ``DEFAULT_TIMESLICE`` - Default timeslice duration (10ms)

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    for (auto& item : large_dataset) {
        process(item);
        co_await maybe_yield();  // Yield only if timeslice exceeded
    }

    // Custom timeslice configuration
    set_timeslice_duration(std::chrono::milliseconds(5));
    
    for (auto& chunk : process_chunks()) {
        process_chunk(chunk);
        co_await maybe_yield();  // Yields after 5ms instead of 10ms
    }

CoroTask
--------

User-facing coroutine task type with awaitable interface and combinators.

CoroTask<T> supports:

- Awaiting to get the result of type T
- Composing with channel operations
- Exception propagation
- Integration with the task scheduler

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    CoroTask<int> compute_value() {
        co_return 42;
    }

    CoroTask<void> use_value() {
        int result = co_await compute_value();
        // result == 42
        co_return;
    }

Channel
-------

Thread-safe producer-consumer queue for streaming data between tasks.

Channel<T> supports bounded capacity, async send/receive, and producer tracking.
Multiple producers can register themselves, and the channel automatically closes
when the last producer exits (via ProducerGuard RAII).

**Features:**

- Bounded or unbounded capacity
- Async send() and receive() with awaitable interface
- ProducerGuard RAII for automatic close on producer exit
- Producer pre-registration for CoroScope spawn patterns
- Thread-safe waiters queue for back-pressure coordination

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto channel = make_channel<int>(100);

    // Producer: channel->producer() increments the producer count
    // immediately, then .guard() adopts the slot for RAII cleanup.
    auto task = make_task(
        [ch = channel->producer()](CoroScope& scope) mutable
            -> CoroTask<void> {
            auto guard = ch.guard();
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
                co_await ch.send(i);
            }
            // ~ProducerGuard auto-releases; channel closes when last exits
            co_return;
        }, "Producer");

    // Consumer: receive until channel closes
    while (auto value = co_await channel->receive()) {
        std::cout << *value << "\n";  // value is std::optional<int>
    }

**Multiple producers pattern:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto channel = make_channel<Chunk>(0);

    // channel->producer() increments the count eagerly on the caller's
    // thread, so the channel never transiently sees zero producers
    // while coroutines are still being scheduled.
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        scope.spawn([ch = channel->producer(),
                     i](CoroScope& s) mutable -> CoroTask<void> {
            auto guard = ch.guard();
            for (auto chunk : read_my_chunks(i)) {
                co_await ch.send(std::move(chunk));
            }
            // ~ProducerGuard releases the slot; channel closes when all exit
        });
    }

ChannelProducer / ChannelConsumer
---------------------------------

``ChannelProducer<T>`` and ``ChannelConsumer<T>`` are lightweight capture-safe
handles obtained from ``channel->producer()`` and ``channel->consumer()``. They
are the idiomatic way to hand a channel to a coroutine lambda: the handle can be
captured by value into a ``spawn``/``make_task`` closure and (for shared_ptr
channels) keeps the channel alive for as long as the coroutine runs.

``ChannelProducer`` increments the producer count eagerly in its constructor, so
the channel never transiently observes zero producers while coroutines are still
being scheduled. Inside the coroutine body, call ``guard()`` once to adopt the
pre-registered slot as a ``ProducerGuard`` (RAII); the channel closes when the
last producer's guard is destroyed. ``send(item)`` forwards to the channel.

``ChannelConsumer`` is copyable and exposes ``receive()`` (an awaitable that
yields ``std::optional<T>``, empty once the channel is closed and drained).

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto channel = make_channel<Chunk>(0);

    // Producer side: capture the handle, adopt the guard, send, then exit.
    scope.spawn([ch = channel->producer()](CoroScope& s) mutable
                    -> CoroTask<void> {
        auto guard = ch.guard();
        for (auto chunk : read_chunks()) {
            co_await ch.send(std::move(chunk));
        }
    });  // ~ProducerGuard releases the slot

    // Consumer side: receive until the channel closes.
    scope.spawn([ch = channel->consumer()](CoroScope& s) -> CoroTask<void> {
        while (auto item = co_await ch.receive()) {
            process(*item);  // item is std::optional<Chunk>
        }
    });

Generator
---------

Synchronous lazy sequence generator using ``co_yield``.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    Generator<int> fibonacci(int n) {
        int a = 0, b = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            co_yield a;
            auto next = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = next;
        }
    }

    // Lazy iteration - only computes values as needed
    for (int fib : fibonacci(10)) {
        std::cout << fib << " ";  // 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
    }

AsyncGenerator
--------------

Asynchronous lazy sequence generator for async iteration.

Allows coroutines to produce a sequence of values asynchronously.
Use ``co_await gen.next()`` to await the next value.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    AsyncGenerator<std::string> read_lines(const std::string& path) {
        auto fd = co_await io::async_open(path.c_str(), O_RDONLY);
        std::string line;
        while (co_await io::async_readline(fd, line)) {
            co_yield line;
        }
    }

    // Async iteration - each line read asynchronously
    auto gen = read_lines("data.txt");
    while (auto line = co_await gen.next()) {
        process(*line);
    }

when_all
--------

Wait for all awaitables to complete.

Suspends until all provided awaitables have completed, then returns their results
as a tuple.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Race multiple tasks and wait for all to complete
    auto [result_a, result_b, result_c] = co_await when_all({
        compute_async_a(),
        compute_async_b(),
        compute_async_c()
    });

    // Or with a vector of awaitables
    std::vector<CoroTask<int>> tasks;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        tasks.push_back(compute_async(i));
    }
    auto results = co_await when_all(std::move(tasks));
    // results is std::vector<int>

when_any
--------

Race multiple awaitables, return first to complete.

Suspends until at least one awaitable completes, then returns the index and result
of the first one.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Race three I/O operations, use whichever completes first
    auto result = co_await when_any({
        io::async_read(cache_fd, buf, len),
        io::async_read(disk_fd, buf, len),
        io::async_read(network_fd, buf, len)
    });

    // result.index tells which completed first
    switch (result.index) {
        case 0:
            std::cout << "Cache hit\n";
            break;
        case 1:
            std::cout << "Local disk\n";
            break;
        case 2:
            std::cout << "Network fetch\n";
            break;
    }
    process(result.result);

Heterogeneous when_all and when_any
------------------------------------

The variadic overloads of ``when_all`` and ``when_any`` accept awaitables of
different types. Return types are deduced automatically: ``when_all`` returns a
``std::tuple`` of each awaitable's result type, and ``when_any`` returns a
``WhenAnyTupleResult`` with index-based ``get<N>()`` access to the winning
result. ``void`` results map to ``std::monostate`` in both cases.

**Heterogeneous when_all:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Wait for tasks returning different types
    auto f_int = scope.spawn([](CoroScope&) -> CoroTask<int> {
        co_return 42;
    });
    auto f_str = scope.spawn([](CoroScope&) -> CoroTask<std::string> {
        co_return std::string("hello");
    });

    // Returns std::tuple<int, std::string>
    auto [num, text] = co_await when_all(std::move(f_int), std::move(f_str));

**Void handling in when_all:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Void results map to std::monostate in the tuple
    auto f_void = scope.spawn([](CoroScope&) -> CoroTask<void> {
        co_return;
    });
    auto f_int = scope.spawn([](CoroScope&) -> CoroTask<int> {
        co_return 99;
    });

    // Returns std::tuple<std::monostate, int>
    auto [_, val] = co_await when_all(std::move(f_void), std::move(f_int));

**Heterogeneous when_any:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Race tasks returning different types
    auto f_int = scope.spawn([](CoroScope&) -> CoroTask<int> {
        co_return 42;
    });
    auto f_str = scope.spawn([](CoroScope&) -> CoroTask<std::string> {
        co_return std::string("hello");
    });

    // Returns WhenAnyTupleResult - use get<N>() for index-based access
    auto result = co_await when_any(std::move(f_int), std::move(f_str));

    // result.index tells which awaitable completed first (0-based).
    // get<N>() works correctly even when types repeat.
    if (result.index == 0) {
        int val = result.get<0>();
    } else {
        std::string val = result.get<1>();
    }
    result.cancel_remaining();

**Overload resolution:**

The correct overload is selected automatically via ``requires`` constraints:

- All arguments share the same type -> homogeneous (vector-based) overload,
  returning ``std::vector<T>`` or ``WhenAnyResult<T>``.
- Arguments have different types -> heterogeneous overload,
  returning ``std::tuple<...>`` or ``WhenAnyTupleResult<...>`` (with ``get<N>()`` access).

No explicit template arguments are needed; the compiler resolves the overload
based on the argument types.

AsyncMutex
----------

Lock-free async mutex for coroutines. Ownership is not tied to any thread -
a coroutine holding the lock can migrate freely. Waiting coroutines suspend
without blocking the OS thread and are resumed in approximate FIFO order.

Used, for example, to serialize writes to a shared ``ChunkWriter`` across
parallel producer coroutines.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <dftracer/utils/core/coro/async_mutex.h>

    AsyncMutex mutex;

    // Manual lock/unlock
    co_await mutex.lock();
    co_await writer.write_line(data);
    mutex.unlock();

    // RAII release via AsyncMutexGuard (recommended). Acquire the lock,
    // then adopt the AsyncMutex into a guard that unlocks on scope exit.
    {
        co_await mutex.lock();
        AsyncMutexGuard guard(mutex);
        co_await writer.write_line(data);
    }  // ~AsyncMutexGuard calls mutex.unlock()

    // Non-blocking try_lock
    if (mutex.try_lock()) {
        // acquired
        mutex.unlock();
    }

**API surface:**

- ``lock()`` - returns ``AsyncMutexLockOperation`` (awaitable); acquires without
  suspending when uncontended, otherwise suspends until the lock is free.
- ``unlock()`` - release the lock and resume the next waiter (approx. FIFO).
- ``try_lock()`` - non-blocking attempt; returns ``true`` on acquisition.

``AsyncMutexGuard`` is a move-only RAII wrapper (constructed from an already
locked ``AsyncMutex&``) whose destructor calls ``unlock()``. It does not acquire
the lock itself - ``co_await mutex.lock()`` first.

TimeoutAwaitable
----------------

Timeout awaitable for use with ``when_any``.

Allows racing a task against a timeout to implement deadline-based cancellation.

Usage example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
    
    auto& timer_service = executor->get_timer_service();
    auto result = co_await when_any({
        slow_operation(),
        timeout(5s, &timer_service)
    });

    if (result.index == 1) {
        std::cerr << "Operation timed out\n";
    } else {
        process(result.result);
    }

Promise Types
-------------

The framework defines the coroutine promise types directly; users rarely name
them, but they are the machinery behind the awaitable types above. Every promise
routes its frame allocation through ``ObjectPool`` to avoid per-coroutine
``operator new`` calls.

``PromiseBase`` (``task.h``) is the shared base of the ``CoroTask<T>`` promise.
It holds the continuation handle, the owning ``Executor`` / ``Scheduler``, an
optional cancellation token, and a pointer to the root promise used for
task-graph accounting. ``CoroTask``'s promise adds typed result storage on top
(via ``return_value`` / ``return_void``).

``CoroPromise`` (``coro.h``) is the promise type for ``Coro`` (fire-and-forget).
It carries the join-group counter and continuation pointers used by
``JoinHandle``, the owning ``Executor``, a ``TaskIndex``, and a ``released``
flag that tells the final-suspend awaiter to schedule deferred frame
destruction. It has no result slot - ``Coro`` communicates through channels.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // You write ordinary coroutine functions; the compiler picks the promise:
    CoroTask<int> typed();   // promise derives from PromiseBase, stores int
    Coro          fire();    // promise is CoroPromise, no return value

FireAndForget
-------------

Minimal self-destroying coroutine type used internally by the ``when_all`` /
``when_any`` wrappers. Its promise never suspends (``std::suspend_never`` at both
initial and final suspend), returns void, and calls ``std::terminate()`` on an
unhandled exception (wrappers are written to never throw). Like the other
promises, its frame is allocated from ``ObjectPool``.

It has no user-facing awaitable interface; it exists so a wrapper coroutine can
run to completion and free its own frame without anyone awaiting it. Prefer
``Coro`` or ``SpawnFuture`` for application-level fire-and-forget work.

CompletionLatch
---------------

Single-word atomic that resolves the suspend-vs-complete race for a group
awaitable: the awaiter setting its "suspended" bit and a child setting the
"completed" bit both ``fetch_or`` into one atomic, and whichever side observes
the other's bit already set is the one that resumes the awaiting coroutine.
Because both operate on a single modification order, there is no lost or double
wakeup.

Two members return ``true`` when this side won the race and must resume the
continuation:

.. code-block:: cpp

    bool on_suspended() noexcept;   // awaiter has suspended
    bool on_completed() noexcept;   // a child has completed

The free function ``resume_continuation(Executor*, std::coroutine_handle<>)``
resumes the continuation through the executor when present (else inline),
guarding a null or already-done handle. This is an internal building block for
``when_all`` / ``when_any``; application code does not use it directly.

CompletionState
---------------

Reusable base bundling the state that ``when_all`` and ``when_any`` share: the
awaiting coroutine handle, its ``Executor``, and a ``CompletionLatch``. Its
``mark_suspended_and_check_completion()`` is called from ``await_suspend`` after
deciding to suspend; if the latch reports completion already happened, it
resumes the continuation.

Two derived states implement the two combinators:

- ``WhenAllCompletionState`` - all-of accounting; resumes only after every child
  completes, recording the first exception observed (``on_one_complete()`` /
  ``on_exception()``).
- ``WhenAnyCompletionState`` - first-of accounting; resumes on the first child to
  complete (``on_first_complete()``).

These are internal to the ``when_all`` / ``when_any`` implementations; use the
combinators, not these states, from application code.
