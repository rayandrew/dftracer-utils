C++ API Reference
=================

The C++20 engine: the coroutine runtime, the columnar DataFrame, the query
builder, the trace-analysis layer, and the plugin SDK. Every page renders C++
classes and namespaces from the source through Doxygen and Breathe. For the
stable C ABI, see :doc:`../c_api/index`.

Architecture
------------

The five layered libraries and how they build on one another. ``core`` is the
foundation; each arrow points to the library built on top, up to the top domain
layer that composes all below it.
