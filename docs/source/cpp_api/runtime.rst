:description: Reference for the core async runtime: the Pipeline and Executor, the scheduler and watchdog, the Error type, and shared concurrency primitives.

Runtime
=======

.. seealso::

   :doc:`../pipeline` and :doc:`../concepts/async-runtime` for the runtime
   model, and :doc:`coro`, :doc:`io`, and :doc:`task_graph` for the primitives
   it drives.

The core async runtime lives in ``dftracer::utils``: the ``Pipeline`` and
``Executor`` that own worker threads and the coroutine scheduler, the
``Scheduler``, ``Watchdog``, and ``TimerService`` services, the ``Error`` type,
and the shared concurrency and memory primitives (sharded map, object and buffer
pools, string interning) used across the engine.

Type relationships
