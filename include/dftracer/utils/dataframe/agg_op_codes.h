/* Stable aggregate op codes shared by the dataframe C ABI (dftu_agg_spec) and
   the plugin ABI (dftu_agg_col), so a plugin author selects an aggregate by a
   named enum, not a bare int. The values mirror dataframe::AggOp; a
   static_assert in agg.cpp keeps the two definitions in lockstep. The C seams
   still carry the code as a fixed-width int for ABI stability and range-check
   it at the boundary. */
